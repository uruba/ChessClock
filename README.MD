#ChessClock
This will be a chess clock application for Windows Phone 8.1 (promoted to a Windows 10 universal app in time).

It is still very early in the development, so there's not much to see here just yet. However, you are more than welcome to join the effort â€“ if you so will. In that case message me at [uruba@outlook.com](mailto:uruba@outlook.com) and we can talk further.

## Planned features

* customizable countdown options
* various UI layouts
